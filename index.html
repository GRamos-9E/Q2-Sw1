	<td>Ice Bear is a character from the show "We Bare Bears". He is one of the 3 bears besides Grizz and Pan-pan. Ice Bear is the silent one among the 3 bears and doesn't talk much. He always starts his sentence saying "ice bear" and only says a few words.</td>

	<td>Peter Griffin is the main protagonist in the adult cartoon "Family Guy". He is the father of his kids Meg, Chris and Stewie and the wife of Lois Griffin. Peter Griffin is very immature as a character, father, husband, and human being with his actions often leading to bad consequences to himself and others.</td>
	<td>He is mostly known in the series for his wild and often immature antics. There was one episode where he worked for Donald Trump in the White House with the episode ending in an epic 1v1 battle against Trump. He reminds me of myself for having a crazy personality.</td>
